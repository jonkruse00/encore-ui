# Description

Encore UI includes a grid system forked from [Angular Material's layout module](https://material.angularjs.org/#/layout/container) with minor usability enhancements to provide an assortment of attribute-based layout options based on the flexbox layout model. Included are intuitive attribute based styles that ease the creation of responsive row and/or column based page layouts.

## Note About Responsive Features

Two versions of the Encore UI CSS file are included in this project. One includes responsive design style attributes (encore-ui-resp-x.x.x.css). The other omits these attributes to save space if desired (encore-ui-x.x.x.css). Be sure to only include the appropriate css file for your project. Any attributes which include the following suffixes require the responsive css file to work: '-sm', '-gt-sm', '-md', '-gt-md', '-lg', '-gt-lg'.
